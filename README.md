# Debugging of DBpedia SPARQL Queries
## University of Almer√≠a, 2025

This is the repository of the debugger built for DBpedia SPARQL queries. The debugging technique for DBpedia queries aimed at aligning a specific query with expected and unexpected answers. 
By converting SPARQL into rules, the debugger identifies query rewrites that meet these criteria. It employs constraint solving to determine filter conditions aligning with expected and unexpected results. 

Here you can find:

### The code of the SWI-Prolog implementation of the debugger (file dbprex.pl)
